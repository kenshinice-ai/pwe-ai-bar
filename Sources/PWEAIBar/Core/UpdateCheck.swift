/// The update check.
///
/// A menu-bar app is the kind of thing you install once and then stop thinking about, which
/// makes it exactly the kind of thing that keeps a fixed bug for months. 1.1.6 fixed a keychain
/// prompt storm and 50% idle CPU; without this, every copy already installed keeps both faults
/// until its owner happens to type `brew upgrade` — and most of the people this is for have no
/// reason to know that command exists.
///
/// **What it sends is the whole of it: the product, this build's version, and the macOS
/// version.** No machine fingerprint, no account, no provider tokens, no quota figures. PWE Loan
/// Bar's equivalent does send a fingerprint because it counts seats against a licence; this app
/// has no licence and therefore nothing to count, so it asks for nothing it cannot use.
///
/// The check is off until the reader says yes, asked once, and changeable in Settings after
/// that. Failure is silent: someone on a plane or behind a corporate proxy must never see an
/// error from a convenience.
/// **This file is duplicated in three apps, deliberately, and the duplication is checked.**
/// PWE AI Bar, PWE Monitor and PWE Lumen Bar each carry a copy differing only in `product`, in
/// `downloadPage`, and in which function answers "is the interface in Chinese".
///
/// A shared package was designed and then measured against what it would buy. Three repositories
/// and three build systems -- SwiftPM, a raw `swiftc` line, and an Xcode project -- mean a package
/// costs a fourth repository, a build-system migration for one app, and "edit, tag, bump three
/// dependents" on every change: the same work moved somewhere else, plus a mechanism to learn.
/// What the duplication actually costs is one thing, and only one: nobody being told when a fix
/// reaches one copy and not the others.
///
/// `07 TOOLS/check-shared-sources.py` is that one thing. It compares the five functions carrying
/// the behaviour, ignores the configuration that is supposed to differ, and all three release
/// scripts run it. **Change all three -- and the release will tell you if you did not.**
